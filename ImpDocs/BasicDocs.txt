========================================================

#Building approvals

1)Does the building have the necessary approval (i.e layout,..) from the Panchayats/CMDA/DTCP/MMDA
2)Does builder have completion certificate from the concerned authority.
3)Check that the property belongs to which zone (Resi/Agri/Comm/Aquifier/Non-Resi/industrial/Special)
4)Check the documents with a Banker for Loan Possibility (without patta & Approval loan is not possible)
5)Check that the Layout has been alloted OSR Area ( temple, school, park, shop ) or else the owner has to pay 10% of the land value to the Government for approval. Only if the layout exceeds 3000sqm,32258sqft,74Cents 
6)The Zone type and the Road Width defines how much area you can build, in case Aquafier Recharge Zone you can get only 0.8 FSI wherels in residential Zone you get 1.5 FSI
7)SBI seems to have the most stringent legal policies. So if a project is rejected by SBI, one should show extra caution.
8) This is fixed monthly outflow that most people don’t take into consideration while decision-making. Newer constructions (especially the ones with exotic “themes”) can have a pretty high Maintenance outflow. There are some in Mumbai, where it’s as high as 10,000-12,000 per month.
9)without taking proper approval of the layout plans and as a result of which the possession could not be delivered to the prospective allottee

#Area of the flat
1)In most of the new construction the super-buildup to carpet area ratio is barely 60-65%
2)Check out the individual flat plan and match it with the actual size of the flat. Take extra care to match(measure) the size of balconies. This is where most of the builder do plan violation by increasing the size of balconies to get extra money. That’s because the expenditure on the balcony for construction is the least but the customer pays the price as part of the Super Built Up Area.
3)Again measure the exact size(carpet area) of the flat. Most of the customer take the word of builder as sacrosanct when it comes to stated size of flat, but on calculation one can many times find a 2-5% shortfall. Remember that can mean a difference of 80k to 2 lac rupee difference in a 40 lac flat. Now you get it! right ?
4)Check out your undivided share of land. Very simply put an unit of undivided share of land equals (total super built area of all flats in the complex)/(total size of land for the complex). So, to reach at the undivided share of land alloted for your flat it should be (your super built up area) * (the unit calculated above). Lot of times this is overstated by builder to attract customers. But remember, if there is a natural calamity like earthquake,fire etc and the building gets destroyed it’s only the undivided share of land which you really own. Don’t leave it for later. Builder which do not allot undivided share of land to buyers are a strict no-no (yes there are such builders).
5)It should have the municipal-approved plan of the flat, carpet area with the area of the balconies shown separately, price of the property including the proportionate price of common areas and facilities shown separately.

#Finances
1)If the buyer has secured a home loan for the flat, its repayment schedule is treated as pre-EMI till the buyer gets the property's possession. A buyer is entitled to tax rebate under sections 24 (b) and 80 (c) of the Income-Tax Act 1961 only after securing possession of the property and thus commencement of EMI. Till then, he gets no tax relief on the pre-EMI. Thus, the buyer has to pay the EMIs of the bank and also the rent for his current residence. The financial loss and mental agony that the buyer has to face cannot be compensated except by giving him the physical possession of his house.

Glossary

1) Covered Area : This is the Actual Area under the roof.
2) Carpet Area  : Carpet Area is the area where we can spread a carpet, means area calculated from inner wall to wall distance  inside the house.
3)Built-up Area : Carpet Area + Area of walls and ducts+ 1/2 the Area of terrace. (Usually 10% more than the carpet area).
A terrace is considered as half the actual area for calculating built up area.
4)Super Built Up Area : his is built up area + area occupied by common amenities like lifts, corridors, awnings, club house, stairs. Super built up is usually around 25% more than Built up area. This is also called as Salable Area.

====
CARPET AREA :
 Total carpet area : total carpet areas of all rooms,varandas, passages, area inside the main door (if not included in living room dimension), balconies
  FSI is applicable to carpet area.
  Depending upon builder practice, carpet area may be 50% to 70% of of saleable area
  ratio of carpet area to the saleable area, higher the ratio, better it is.
  The example below will illustrate trick used by builders/developers, when they say you can find carpet area by applying loading factor on the saleable area.
Saleable Area: 1200 sq ft
Loading Factor: 25% (or 1.25)

Wrong Method (favours seller):
Carpet Area: 1200 x (100-25)% = 1200 x 75% = 900 sq ft
If you apply 1.25 or 25% loading, saleable area should be 900 sq ft + 900 x 25% = 1125 sq ft
As you can see under this method builder is charging you for 1200 - 1125 = 75 sq ft more

Right Method (favours buyer):
Find carpet area first by measuring actual dimensions, and then apply loading factor
Saleable area = 900 sq ft + 900 x 25% = 1125 sq ft
